# Linear regression

The given dataset vw_data.csv provides information on used cars that were advertised on the e-commerce platform Exchange and Mart in the UK in 2020. The dataset is restricted to models by the manufacturer Volkswagen (VW). It is an extract of a larger data set available on kaggle.com.

Additionally to the model name, the data set contains the following eight variables:
 * price—the price of the cars, in 1000 GBP (£);
 * year—the year that the car was first registered in;
 * mileage—the total distance (in 1000 miles) the car has been driven;
 * mpg—the distance (in miles) the car can travel with one gallon (imperial) of fuel;
 * fuelType—the type of fuel the car consumes;
 * engineSize—the size of the car’s engine in litres;
 * tax—the amount of the annual tax (Vehicle Excise Duty) to be paid for the car;
 * transmission—the type of gearbox the car has.

# Tasks

1. In this project, the unit for measuring fuel consumption shall be l/(100km) (litres per 100 km). Convert the variable mpg to this new unit.
2. Use the variable year to calculate the cars’ age, and use the obtained values to define the new variable age. Replace the variable year with age in the data set.
3. Build a linear regression model to predict price from the other covariates. Decide whether it is better to use price or log(price) as the response variable. Apply appropriate model selection techniques to choose a good set of explanatory variables, e.g. best subset selection based on Akaikes Information Criterion (AIC) or Mallow’s Cp statistic.
4. Interpret the coefficients of the model and their statistical significance, provide confidence intervals for the regression parameters, and evaluate the goodness of fit.
